# Machine_Learning_Project
This repository contains the documentation of our work in the course project of BITS 464 Machine Learning. 

We begin by the implementation of the paper "DNA Sequence Classification by Convolutional Neural Network" by Nguyen et al.
Out of the 12 datasets mentioned in the paper, we selected the H3K4me1 to work with. The dataset used and the code for base model implementation can be found here.

## Further changes made include:
1. Hyperparameter Tuning
2. Utilisation of 4 mer representation
3. Utilisation of Word2Vec embedding
4. Utilisation of Hybrid models

Code used for every model has been attached in the repository.
